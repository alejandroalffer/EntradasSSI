        All credentials in the Alastria Id model has an assurance level depending on the issuer authority who generates those credentials. The three levels defined in the protocol are:
        • Basic: any alastria issuer can emit basic level credentials.
        • Medium: only issuers governmentaly recognized can emit medium level credentials.
        • High: only issuers governmentaly recognized with specific hardware can emit high level credentials.
        Convergence Wallet by IN2 is medium level credential compatible, although there isn’t any authorized medium level issuer yet.
